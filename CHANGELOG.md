## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- 704928b: fix(setup): enable APIs individually and surface gcloud errors

  Previously `gws auth setup` used a single batch `gcloud services enable` call
  for all Workspace APIs. If any one API failed, the entire batch was marked as
  failed and stderr was silently discarded. APIs are now enabled individually and
  in parallel, with error messages surfaced to the user.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 92e66a3: Add `gws version` as a bare subcommand alongside `gws --version` and `gws -V`

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 8fadbd6: Smarter truncation of method and resource descriptions from discovery docs. Descriptions now truncate at sentence boundaries when possible, fall back to word boundaries with an ellipsis, and strip markdown links to reclaim character budget. Fixes #64.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- b3669e0: Add hourly cron to generate-skills workflow to auto-sync skills with upstream Google Discovery API changes via PR
- e8d533e: Add workflow to publish OpenClaw skills to ClawHub
- 3b38c8d: Sync generated skills with latest Google Discovery API specs

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 670267f: feat: add `gws mcp` Model Context Protocol server

  Adds a new `gws mcp` subcommand that starts an MCP server over stdio,
  exposing Google Workspace APIs as structured tools to any MCP-compatible
  client (Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI, VS Code, etc.).

### Patch Changes

- 8c1042a: Fix x-goog-api-client header format to use `gl-rust/gws-<version>`
- 3de9762: Fix docs: `gws setup` → `gws auth setup` (fixes #56, #57)

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- f281797: docs(auth): add manual Google Cloud OAuth client setup and browser-assisted login guidance

  Adds step-by-step guidance for creating a Desktop OAuth client in Google Cloud Console,
  where to place `client_secret.json`, and how humans/agents can complete browser consent
  (including unverified app and scope-selection prompts).

- ee2e216: Narrow default OAuth scopes to avoid `Error 403: restricted_client` on unverified apps and add a `--full` flag for broader access (fixes #25). Replace the cryptic non-interactive setup error with actionable step-by-step OAuth console instructions (fixes #24).
- de2787e: feat(error): detect disabled APIs and guide users to enable them

  When the Google API returns a 403 `accessNotConfigured` error (i.e., the
  required API has not been enabled for the GCP project), `gws` now:

  - Extracts the GCP Console enable URL from the error message body.
  - Prints the original error JSON to stdout (machine-readable, unchanged shape
    except for an optional new `enable_url` field added to the error object).
  - Prints a human-readable hint with the direct enable URL to stderr, along
    with instructions to retry after enabling.

  This prevents a dead-end experience where users see a raw 403 JSON blob
  with no guidance. The JSON output is backward-compatible; only an optional
  `enable_url` field is added when the URL is parseable from the message.

  Fixes #31

- 4b868c7: docs: add community guidance to gws-shared skill and gws --help output

  Encourages agents and users to star the repository and directs bug reports
  and feature requests to GitHub Issues, with guidance to check for existing
  issues before opening new ones.

- 666f9a8: fix(auth): support --help / -h flag on auth subcommand
- bcd2401: fix: flatten nested objects in table output and fix multi-byte char truncation panic
- ee35e4a: fix: warn to stderr when unknown --format value is provided
- e094b02: fix: YAML block scalar for strings with `#`/`:`, and repeated CSV/table headers with `--page-all`

  **Bug 1 — YAML output: `drive#file` rendered as block scalar**

  Strings containing `#` or `:` (e.g. `drive#file`, `https://…`) were
  incorrectly emitted as YAML block scalars (`|`), producing output like:

  ```yaml
  kind: |
    drive#file
  ```

  Block scalars add an implicit trailing newline which changes the string
  value and produces invalid-looking output. The fix restricts block
  scalar to strings that genuinely contain newlines; all other strings
  are double-quoted, which is safe for any character sequence.

  **Bug 2 — `--page-all` with `--format csv` / `--format table` repeats headers**

  When paginating with `--page-all`, each page printed its own header row,
  making the combined output unusable for downstream processing:

  ```
  id,kind,name          ← page 1 header
  1,drive#file,foo.txt
  id,kind,name          ← page 2 header (unexpected!)
  2,drive#file,bar.txt
  ```

  Column headers (and the table separator line) are now emitted only for
  the first page; continuation pages contain data rows only.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6ae7427: fix(auth): stabilize encrypted credential key fallback across sessions

  When the OS keyring returned `NoEntry`, the previous code could generate
  a fresh random key on each process invocation instead of reusing one.
  This caused `credentials.enc` written by `gws auth login` to be
  unreadable by subsequent commands.

  Changes:

  - Always prefer an existing `.encryption_key` file before generating a new key
  - When generating a new key, persist it to `.encryption_key` as a stable fallback
  - Best-effort write new keys into the keyring as well
  - Fix `OnceLock` race: return the already-cached key if `set` loses a race

  Fixes #27
