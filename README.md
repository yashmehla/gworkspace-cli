```bash
npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli
```

`gws` doesn't ship a static list of commands. It reads Google's own [Discovery Service](https://developers.google.com/discovery) at runtime and builds its entire command surface dynamically. When Google Workspace adds an API endpoint or method, `gws` picks it up automatically.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli

gws auth setup     # walks you through Google Cloud project config + OAuth login
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 5}'
```

Or build from source:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```


## Why gws?

**For humans** — stop writing `curl` calls against REST docs. `gws` gives you tab‑completion, `--help` on every resource, `--dry-run` to preview requests, and auto‑pagination.

**For AI agents** — every response is structured JSON. Pair it with the included agent skills and your LLM can manage Workspace without custom tooling.

```bash
# List the 10 most recent files
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 10}'

# Create a spreadsheet
gws sheets spreadsheets create --json '{"properties": {"title": "Q1 Budget"}}'

# Send a Chat message
gws chat spaces messages create \
  --params '{"parent": "spaces/xyz"}' \
  --json '{"text": "Deploy complete."}' \
  --dry-run

# Introspect any method's request/response schema
gws schema drive.files.list

# Stream paginated results as NDJSON
gws drive files list --params '{"pageSize": 100}' --page-all | jq -r '.files[].name'
```


## Authentication

The CLI supports multiple auth workflows so it works on your laptop, in CI, and on a server.

### Interactive (local desktop)

Credentials are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) with the key stored in your OS keyring.

```bash
gws auth setup       # one-time: creates a Cloud project, enables APIs, logs you in
gws auth login       # subsequent logins
```

> Requires the [`gcloud` CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) to be installed and authenticated.

### Manual OAuth setup (Google Cloud Console)

Use this when `gws auth setup` cannot automate project/client creation, or when you want explicit control.

1. Open Google Cloud Console in the target project:
   - OAuth consent screen: `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=<PROJECT_ID>`
   - Credentials: `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=<PROJECT_ID>`
2. Configure OAuth branding/audience if prompted:
   - App type: **External** (testing mode is fine)
   - Add your account under **Test users**
3. Create an OAuth client:
   - Type: **Desktop app**
4. Download the client JSON and save it to:
   - `~/.config/gws/client_secret.json`

Then run:

```bash
gws auth login
```

### Browser-assisted auth (human or agent)

You can complete OAuth either manually or with browser automation.

- **Human flow**: run `gws auth login`, open the printed URL, approve scopes.
- **Agent-assisted flow**: the agent opens the URL, selects account, handles consent prompts, and returns control once the localhost callback succeeds.

If consent shows **"Google hasn't verified this app"** (testing mode), click **Continue**.
If scope checkboxes appear, select required scopes (or **Select all**) before continuing.

### Headless / CI (export flow)

1. Complete interactive auth on a machine with a browser.
2. Export credentials:
   ```bash
   gws auth export --unmasked > credentials.json
   ```
3. On the headless machine:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/credentials.json
   gws drive files list   # just works
   ```

### Service Account (server-to-server)

Point to your key file; no login needed.

```bash
export GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/service-account.json
gws drive files list
```

For Domain-Wide Delegation, add:

```bash
export GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_IMPERSONATED_USER=admin@example.com
```

### Pre-obtained Access Token

Useful when another tool (e.g. `gcloud`) already mints tokens for your environment.

```bash
export GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)
```

### Precedence

| Priority | Source | Set via |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Access token | `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN` |
| 2 | Credentials file | `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE` |
| 3 | Encrypted credentials (OS keyring) | `gws auth login` |
| 4 | Plaintext credentials | `~/.config/gws/credentials.json` |

Environment variables can also live in a `.env` file.


## AI Agent Skills

The repo ships 100+ Agent Skills (`SKILL.md` files) — one for every supported API, plus higher-level helpers for common workflows and 50 curated recipes for Gmail, Drive, Docs, Calendar, and Sheets. See the full [Skills Index](docs/skills.md) for the complete list.

```bash
# Install all skills at once
npx skills add github:googleworkspace/cli

# Or pick only what you need
npx skills add https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/tree/main/skills/gws-drive
npx skills add https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/tree/main/skills/gws-gmail
```

<details>
<summary>OpenClaw setup</summary>

```bash
# Symlink all skills (stays in sync with repo)
ln -s $(pwd)/skills/gws-* ~/.openclaw/skills/

# Or copy specific skills
cp -r skills/gws-drive skills/gws-gmail ~/.openclaw/skills/
```

The `gws-shared` skill includes an `install` block so OpenClaw auto-installs the CLI via `npm` if `gws` isn't on PATH.

## Gemini CLI Extension

1. Authenticate the CLI first:
   ```bash
   gws auth setup
   ```

2. Install the extension into the Gemini CLI:
   ```bash
   gemini extensions install https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli
   ```

Installing this extension gives your Gemini CLI agent direct access to all `gws` commands and Google Workspace agent skills. Because `gws` handles its own authentication securely, you simply need to authenticate your terminal once prior to using the agent, and the extension will automatically inherit your credentials.

## Advanced Usage

### Multipart Uploads

```bash
gws drive files create --json '{"name": "report.pdf"}' --upload ./report.pdf
```

### Pagination

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--page-all` | Auto-paginate, one JSON line per page (NDJSON) | off |
| `--page-limit <N>` | Max pages to fetch | 10 |
| `--page-delay <MS>` | Delay between pages | 100 ms |

### Model Armor (Response Sanitization)

Integrate [Google Cloud Model Armor](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/model-armor) to scan API responses for prompt injection before they reach your agent.

```bash
gws gmail users messages get --params '...' \
  --sanitize "projects/P/locations/L/templates/T"
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_SANITIZE_TEMPLATE` | Default Model Armor template |
| `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_SANITIZE_MODE` | `warn` (default) or `block` |


## Architecture

`gws` uses a **two-phase parsing** strategy:

1. Read `argv[1]` to identify the service (e.g. `drive`)
2. Fetch the service's Discovery Document (cached 24 h)
3. Build a `clap::Command` tree from the document's resources and methods
4. Re-parse the remaining arguments
5. Authenticate, build the HTTP request, execute

All output — success, errors, download metadata — is structured JSON.


## Troubleshooting

### API not enabled — `accessNotConfigured`

If a required Google API is not enabled for your GCP project, you will see a
403 error with reason `accessNotConfigured`:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 403,
    "message": "Gmail API has not been used in project 549352339482 ...",
    "reason": "accessNotConfigured",
    "enable_url": "https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/gmail.googleapis.com/overview?project=549352339482"
  }
}
```

`gws` also prints an actionable hint to **stderr**:

```
💡 API not enabled for your GCP project.
   Enable it at: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/gmail.googleapis.com/overview?project=549352339482
   After enabling, wait a few seconds and retry your command.
```

**Steps to fix:**
1. Click the `enable_url` link (or copy it from the `enable_url` JSON field).
2. In the GCP Console, click **Enable**.
3. Wait ~10 seconds, then retry your `gws` command.

> [!TIP]
> You can also run `gws auth setup` which walks you through enabling all required
> APIs for your project automatically.


## Development

```bash
cargo build                       # dev build
cargo clippy -- -D warnings       # lint
cargo test                        # unit tests
./scripts/coverage.sh             # HTML coverage report → target/llvm-cov/html/
```
